There are two styles of booklet, depending on your page/input and sheet/output size:

n=2: Two of your pages fit on one side of a sheet (eg statement on letter, A5 on A4)
Assemble by printing on both sides (odd pages on the front and even pages on the back) and folding down the middle.

A variant of n=2 is a technique to bind your own hardback book.
It works best when the source PDF holding your book content has at least 128 pages.
You bind your paper in eight sheet folios each making up 32 pages of your book.
Each sheet is going to make four pages of your book, gets printed on both sides and folded in half.
For such a multi folio booklet set 'multifolio:on' and play around with 'foliosize' which defaults to 8.

n=4: Four of your pages fit on one side of a sheet (eg statement on ledger, A5 on A3, A6 on A4)
Assemble by printing on both sides, then cutting the sheets horizontally.
The sets of pages on the bottom of the sheet are rotated so that the cut side of the
paper is on the bottom of the booklet for every page. After cutting, place the bottom
set of pages after the top set of pages in the booklet. Then fold the half sheets.
